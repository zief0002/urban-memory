It also show the equivalent built-in R functions for obtaining this.\nThe handouts include more detail than I will cover in class. I will highlight some important ideas from each of them, and you can work through some of the mathematical derivation on your own if it is of interest.\n\n\n\n",

You may want to refer to the Matrix Algebra for Educational Scientists text.\nYou will likely be learning (or re-encountering) many new mathematical terms. It is a good idea to note and define all the vocabulary/terms that you encounter as you work through this worksheet. You may want to do this individually or create a shared document that you can all contribute to.\n\nProblems\nConsider the following matrices:\n\\[\n\\mathbf{A} = \\begin{bmatrix}3 & -2\\\\5 & 1\\end{bmatrix} \\quad \\mathbf{B} = \\begin{bmatrix}3 & -1\\\\-1 & 2\\end{bmatrix}\\quad \\mathbf{C} = \\begin{bmatrix}1 & 2 & 3\\\\0 & 1 & 2\\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\nMake sure everyone in your group can solve each of these problem by hand and using R.\nWhat are the dimensions of A? C?\nIs C a square matrix? Explain.\nFind the trace of A.\nFind the determinant of A.\nAdd A and B\nFind the transpose of C.\nBy referring to the dimensions, can you compute AC? How about CA?\nCompute AC.\nCompute BI\nCreate a \\(3\\times3\\) diagonal matrix whose trace is 10.\nHow do you know that B has an inverse? Explain.\nCompute \\(\\mathbf{B}^{-1}\\)\nCreate a \\(3\\times3\\) matrix that has rank 2. Verify this using R.\nCreate a \\(3\\times3\\) matrix that is symmetric and is not I.\nSolve the system of linear equations using algebra (e.g., substitution, elimination) and then solve them using matrix methods (with R). To do this you will need to read the Systems of Equations chapter in Matrix Algebra for Educational Scientists.\n\\[\n\\begin{split}\nx + y + z &= 2 \\\\\n6x - 4y + 5z &= 31 \\\\\n5x + 2y + 2z &= 13\n\\end{split}\n\\]\n\n\n\n",

In this assignment, you will use the data given below that includes measurements for 10 countries on: infant mortality rate per 1000 live births (infant), the per-capita income (pci) and world region (region) of the country.\n\ncountry\ninfant\npci\nregion\nAlgeria\n86.3\n400\nAfrica\nBolivia\n60.4\n200\nAmericas\nBurundi\n150.0\n68\nAfrica\nDominican Republic\n48.8\n406\nAmericas\nKenya\n55.0\n169\nAfrica\nMalawi\n148.3\n130\nAfrica\nNicaragua\n46.0\n507\nAmericas\nParaguay\n38.6\n347\nAmericas\nRwanda\n132.9\n61\nAfrica\nTrinidad & Tobago\n26.2\n732\nAmericas\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstructions\nSubmit a printed document of your responses to the following questions. Please adhere to the following guidelines for further formatting your assignment:\nAll plots should be resized so that they do not take up more room than necessary.\nAll figures and tables should have a name (e.g., Figure 1) and an appropriate caption.\nIn questions that ask you to ‚Äúuse matrix algebra‚Äù to solve the problem, you can either show your syntax and output from carrying out the matrix operations, or you can use Equation Editor to input the matrices involved in your calculations.\nThis assignment is worth 20 points.\n\nUnstandardized Regression\nYou will be fitting the model lm(infant ~ 1 + pci + region + pci:region). Within this model, use dummy coding to encode the region predictor and make Americas the reference group.\nWrite out the elements of the matrix \\(\\mathbf{X}^{\\intercal}\\mathbf{X}\\), where \\(\\mathbf{X}\\) is the design matrix.\nDoes \\(\\mathbf{X}^{\\intercal}\\mathbf{X}\\) have an inverse? Explain.\nCompute (using matrix algebra) and report the vector of coefficients, b for the OLS regression.\nCompute (using matrix algebra) and report the variance‚Äìcovariance matrix of the coefficients.\nUse the values from b (Question 3) and from the variance‚Äìcovariance matrix you reported in the previous question to find the 95% CI for the coefficient associated with the main-effect of PCI. (Hint: If you need to refresh yourself on how CIs are computed, see here.)\nCompute (using matrix algebra) and report the hat-matrix, H. Also show how you would use the values in the hat-matrix to find \\(\\hat{y}_1\\) (the predicted value for Algeria).\nCompute (using matrix algebra) and report the vector of residuals, e.\nCompute (using matrix algebra) and report the estimated value for the RMSE.\nGiven the assumptions of the OLS model and the RMSE estimate you computed in the previous question, compute and report the variance‚Äìcovariance matrix of the residuals.\n\nANOVA Decomposition\nIn this section you will be re-creating the output from the ANOVA decomposition for the model fitted in the previous section.\nCompute (using matrix algebra) and report the model, residual, and total sum of squares terms in the ANOVA decomposition table. (2pts)\nCompute (using matrix algebra) and report the model, residual, and total degrees of freedom terms in the ANOVA decomposition table. (2pts)\nUse the values you obtained in Questions 11 and 12 to compute the model and residual mean square terms.\nUse the mean square terms you found in Question 13 to compute the F-value for the model (i.e., to test \\(H_0:\\rho^2=0\\)). Also compute the p-value associated with this F-value. (Hint: If you need to refresh yourself on how F-values or p-values are computed, see here.)\n\nRegression: Effects-Coding\nNow consider fitting the model to the data to examine whether there is an effect of region (no other predictors) on infant mortality. In this model, we will use effects-coding to encode the region variable (see here). This model is often expressed as:\n\\[\n\\mathrm{Infant~Mortality}_i = \\mu + \\alpha_{\\mathrm{Region}} + \\epsilon_i \n\\]\nWrite out the design matrix that would be used to fit this model.\nCompute (using matrix algebra) and report the vector of coefficients, b, from the OLS regression.\nCompute (using matrix algebra) and report the variance‚Äìcovariance matrix for the coefficients.\nExplain why the sampling variances for the coefficients are the same and why the sampling covariance is zero by referring to computations produced in the matrix algebra.
