# Directions

Complete the problems on this worksheet with your smallgroup. You may want to refer to the [Matrix Algebra for Educational Scientists](https://zief0002.github.io/matrix-algebra/) text.

You will likely be learning (or re-encountering) many new mathematical terms. It is a good idea to note and define all the vocabulary/terms that you encounter as you work through this worksheet. You may want to do this individually or create a shared document that you can all contribute to.

<br />

# Problems

Consider the following matrices:

$$
\mathbf{A} = \begin{bmatrix}3 & -2\\5 & 1\end{bmatrix} \quad \mathbf{B} = \begin{bmatrix}3 & -1\\-1 & 2\end{bmatrix}\quad \mathbf{C} = \begin{bmatrix}1 & 2 & 3\\0 & 1 & 2\end{bmatrix}
$$

Make sure everyone in your group can solve each of these problem by hand and using R. 

1. What are the dimensions of **A**? **C**?

2. Is **C** a square matrix? Explain.

3. Find the trace of **A**.

4. Find the determinant of **A**.

5. Add **A** and **B**

6. Find the transpose of **C**.

7. By referring to the dimensions, can you compute **AC**? How about **CA**?

8. Compute **AC**.

9. Compute **BI**

10. Create a $3\times3$ diagonal matrix whose trace is 10.

11. How do you know that **B** has an inverse? Explain.

12. Compute $\mathbf{B}^{-1}$

13. Create a $3\times3$ matrix that has rank 2. Verify this using R.

14. Create a $3\times3$ matrix that is symmetric and is not **I**.

15. Solve the system of linear equations using algebra (e.g., substitution, elimination) and then solve them using matrix methods (with R). To do this you will need to read the [Systems of Equations](https://zief0002.github.io/matrix-algebra/systems-of-equations.html) chapter in *Matrix Algebra for Educational Scientists*.

$$
\begin{split}
x + y + z &= 2 \\
6x - 4y + 5z &= 31 \\
5x + 2y + 2z &= 13
\end{split}
$$
