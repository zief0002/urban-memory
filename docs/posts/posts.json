For this simulation use a sample size of 200.\nCreate the fixed X values you will use in each trial of the simulation. To do this, draw \\(n=200\\) X-values from a uniform distribution with a minimum of \\(-2\\) and a maximum of \\(+2\\). Prior to drawing these values, set your starting seed to 678910. Report the syntax you used, and the first six X values.\nCreate a the Y-values for the first trial of the simulation by using the model:\n\\[\n\\begin{split}\ny_i &= -3.2 + 1.75(x_i) + \\epsilon_i \\\\[2ex]\n\\epsilon_i &\\overset{i.i.d.}{\\sim} \\mathcal{N}(0, \\sigma)\n\\end{split}\n\\]\n\nwhere\n\n\\[\n\\begin{split}\n\\sigma &= e^{\\gamma(x_i)}\\\\[2ex]\ne &\\mathrm{~is~Euhler's~constant~}(\\approx2.718282) \\\\[2ex]\n\\gamma &= 1.5\n\\end{split}\n\\]\n\nHere the variation in the random error is a function of X and random noise.

Explain.\nCarry out 1000 trials of the simulation. (Reminder: Be sure to use these same X values in each trial of the simulation; they are fixed.) For each trial, collect: (a) the estimate of the intercept, (b) the estimate of the slope, and (c) the estimate of the residual standard error.\nCompute and report the mean value for the residual standard error.\nSimulation 2: Homoskedastic Model\nTo evaluate the different estimates from the heteroskedasticity model, we need to compare them to estimates drawn from a homoskedastic model with the same population coefficients. To make the comparisons ‚Äúfair‚Äù, so that we are only evaluating the effects of the heteroskedasticity, we also need to run this simulation using a residual standard error that is equal to the mean from the heteroskedastic simulation (i.e., \\(\\mathtt{sd\\neq1}\\) in the rnorm() function).\nCarry out 1000 trials of the simulation for the appropriate homoskedastic model. (Reminder: Be sure to use these same X values in this simulation as in the previous simulation.) For each trial, collect: (a) the estimate of the intercept, (b) the estimate of the slope, and (c) the estimate of the residual standard error. Report your syntax.\nComparing Results from the Two Simulations: Evaluating the Effects of Hetroskedasticity\nCreate a density plot of the distribution of intercept estimates. Show the density curve for both models on the same plot, differentiating the curves using color, linetype, or both. Also add a vertical line to this plot at the population value of the intercept.\nBased on your responses to Question 8, does the intercept estimate seem to be biased under heteroskedasticity? Explain.\nBased on your responses to Question 8, does the intercept estimate seem to be less efficient under heteroskedasticity? Explain.\nCreate a density plot of the distribution of slope estimates. Show the density curve for both models on the same plot, differentiating the curves using color, linetype, or both. Also add a vertical line to this plot at the population value of the slope\nBased on your responses to Question 11, does the slope estimate seem to be biased under heteroskedasticity?

Explain.\nCreate a density plot of the distribution of residual standard error estimates. Show the density curve for both models on the same plot, differentiating the curves using color, linetype, or both. Also add a vertical line to this plot at the population value of the residual standard error\nBased on your responses to Question 14, does the residual standard error estimate seem to be biased under heteroskedasticity?
