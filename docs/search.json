      "contents": "\nWelcome\nWelcome to EPsy 8264: Advanced Multiple Regression Analysis. This is an advanced seminar for doctoral students in education covering a diverse set of regression methodologies. We will begin with a brief review of the General Linear Model and establishment of a mathematical foundation for the estimation of regression coefficients and standard errors in these models through the use of matrix algebra. The course will also cover more advanced modeling techniques, such as regression diagnostics, WLS and sandwich estimation, PCA, shrinkage methods, model selection and local models.\n\n\n\nClassroom\nTuesday/Thursday (9:45–11:00): Appleby Hall 102\n\nSyllabus\nThe course syllabus is available here.\nMessage from Snoop Dogg about the syllabus\n\nTextbooks\nThe course textbook is available via the University of Minnesota library.\nFox, J.
